# Visual-Search-Alpha
Simulation of how general inhibition on visual cortex benefits visual search

To run the simulation simply copy Simulation_Alpha_Filter.m and SerialSearcher.m into your matlab path and it should run; 
The output is a plot that shows the simulated reaction time for the set sizes specified in the script;
If not modified you should a plot that looks a like the second slide in the powerpoint file;
This powerpoint slide also contains an illustration of the model to roughly explain what it does
